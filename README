HTML Cheat-Sheet to be used in schools. Originally prepared for "Mittelschule
WeiÃŸig". Should server children from 5th grade on.  It's designed to help out,
    even if http://de.selfhtml.org isn't around or to complicated to read.

Should grow with 'addendums' -> make it flexible, easy to understand,
       entertaining. If the kids have fun, soon they will know where to look
       for more.

First addendum could be about content vs style: How to style a page without modifying the content of it.
       
ToDo: Port it to LaTeX.

Please: Use PDF's but don't push'em -> .gitignore

Feel free to comment and improve!

Version 0.1: Basic HTML Tags (bla bla -> 2do)
